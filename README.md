# C Structs & String Demo

This function demonstrates handling **arrays of strings in C using structs**.  
It converts an array of strings into an array of `t_stock_str` structs, storing each string, a copy, and its length.
**Note:** This function was implemented during the **C Piscine at 42 Vienna** as part of my learning exercises.
